# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Machine Learning and Statistics (COMP08055) - Assessment Winter 21/22

The purpose of this assessment is to provide an overview the learning outcomes of the module while also providing sample work to show prospective
employers.

### 1. Repository Structure
1. Readme: [README.md](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08055/blob/main/README.md)

2. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebooks: [scikit-learn.ipynb](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08055/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)

3. Scipy-Stats Jupyter Notebook: [scipy-stats.ipynb](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08055/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)

### 2. Software used

### 3. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may choose these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the demonstrations are at your discretion â€“ you may choose to have an overall spread of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.
 - Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

### 4. Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.
