# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Machine Learning and Statistics (COMP08055) - Assessment Winter 21/22

The purpose of this assessment is to provide an overview the learning outcomes of the module while also providing sample work to show prospective
employers.

### 2. Software used
![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/images/JupyterN.png "Jupyter")
![Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. (Source:downloads.com)

![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/images/cmdr.png "Cmder")
![Cmdr](https://cmder.net/) provides you with an alternative to the Windows default command prompt utility through a more capable console emulator that also comes packing a good-looking graphical user interface. (Source:downloads.com)

### 3. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may choose these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the demonstrations are at your discretion â€“ you may choose to have an overall spread of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.
 - Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

### 4. Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.
